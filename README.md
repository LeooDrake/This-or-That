# This-or-That
An express app project by [Leo](https://github.com/LeooDrake), [Alex](https://github.com/tadyen) and [Justin](https://github.com/jlabruna).

This or That is a randomised ranking game designed to finally determine that age old question *Who would win between your nextdoor neighbour's Pomeranian and a Boeing B-29 Superfortress?*

## What it Does

This or That allows users to vote on random selections from the database. Users are able to sign up for an account, see their own posts and delete them, see a leaderboard, and, of course, make their own submissions.

## Instructions

This one's easy - simply visit the url https://this-or-that-8fb9.onrender.com/  and click the things!

Users are not required to create an account to vote. However, they are required to sign in in order to submit posts.

## Technology Used

This or That is an express app utilising MongoDB / Mongoose as a back end, and render for the web service.

## Future Development

- Allow file uploads in submissions rather than just URLs
- Images not played as much would get played more - some more intelligent matching and ranking
- Allow subject matchups - For example, limited or timed events such as "fruit based challenges"
- Match timer or auto refreshing after a period
- Skip button to skip votes
